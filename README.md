# example-code
small code and programs to show as examples

This repo will have code in a variety of languages but I will have many more examples in my Pages repo [here](https://github.com/quadriplanar/quadriplanar.github.io/tree/master/examples)

This is so that they can run on my GitHub Pages [portfolio](https://quadriplanar.github.io/). The Pages examples will mostly be HTML/JS but will be to show examples of programs/process instead of specific languages
